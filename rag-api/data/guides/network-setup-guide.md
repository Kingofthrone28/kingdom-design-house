# Network Setup and Configuration Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and configuring business networks using Kingdom Design House's network services. Whether you're setting up a new office or upgrading an existing network, this guide will help you understand the process and requirements.

## Pre-Installation Planning

### Site Assessment

Before beginning any network installation, we conduct a thorough site assessment:

1. **Physical Layout Analysis**
   - Measure office space and identify device locations
   - Note wall materials and potential interference sources
   - Identify power outlet locations and electrical capacity
   - Document existing infrastructure (cabling, equipment)

2. **Device Inventory**
   - Count workstations, laptops, and mobile devices
   - Identify servers, printers, and other network devices
   - Document current internet connection and bandwidth
   - Note any specialized equipment requirements

3. **Usage Requirements**
   - Determine peak usage times and bandwidth needs
   - Identify critical applications and their network requirements
   - Document security and compliance requirements
   - Plan for future growth and expansion

### Network Design

Based on the site assessment, we create a custom network design:

1. **Network Topology**
   - Choose appropriate network architecture (star, mesh, hybrid)
   - Design VLAN structure for traffic segmentation
   - Plan IP addressing scheme and subnet allocation
   - Design redundancy and failover systems

2. **Equipment Selection**
   - Select appropriate routers and switches
   - Choose WiFi access points and controllers
   - Specify cabling types and quantities
   - Plan for power over Ethernet (PoE) requirements

## Installation Process

## Configuration Best Practices

### Security Configuration

1. **Access Control**
   - Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Regularly update firmware and security patches
   - Monitor and log all network access

2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Separate guest and employee networks
   - Isolate critical systems and servers
   - Implement micro-segmentation where appropriate
   - Use VLANs to control broadcast domains

3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Set up network monitoring tools
   - Configure SNMP for device monitoring
   - Implement centralized logging
   - Set up alerting for critical events

### Performance Optimization

1. **Bandwidth Management**
   - Implement quality of service (QoS) policies
   - Prioritize critical applications and services
   - Monitor bandwidth usage and plan for growth
   - Configure traffic shaping and rate limiting

2. **Load Balancing**
   - Distribute traffic across multiple links
   - Implement failover and redundancy
   - Use link aggregation for increased bandwidth
   - Configure automatic failover mechanisms

## Testing and Validation

### Network Testing
