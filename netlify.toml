# Note: Trailing slash redirects are handled automatically by Netlify
# when Next.js trailingSlash: true is set. Manual redirects cause
# Google Search Console to flag pages as "redirected" instead of indexing
# them directly. Netlify will automatically serve /path/ from /path/index.html
# and handle /path → /path/ redirects without explicit rules.
